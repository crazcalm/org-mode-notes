* Refinery video
My goal is do something quick, fast and easy to get me back into the swing of things.

** Overview
Thinks I want to cover:
- What is refinery?
- Basic project setup (install, config creation, migrations via sqlite)
- Create an empty database via sqlite cli
- Run migrations

** Tone
I have a lot more writing experience now, so I think I can craft my dialogue in such a way as fun, likable and technical in that order.
The order is important because being "Technical" is not enough. I need people to want to watch me. I need people to want to continue the video. I need to keep in mind that I am selling myself in these videos and my technical ability is only a small part of who I am.
