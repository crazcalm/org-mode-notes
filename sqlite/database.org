* Sqlite3 notes

** Creating an empty sqlite file via the cli
I found the instructions on this [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20155693/how-to-create-an-empty-sqlite-db-with-command][thread]].

~sqlite3 file.db "VACUUM;"~

** Bulk insert syntax not the same as other databases?

It is explained in the [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1609637/how-to-insert-multiple-rows-in-sqlite][thread]], but the high level summary is that I should do something like the following instead:

#+begin_src sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO 'tablename' table VALUES ('data1', 'data2');
INSERT INTO 'tablename' table VALUES ('data3', 'data4');
...
COMMIT;
#+end_src

** CLI
*** Settings I should turn on
#+begin_src text
.changes on
.echo on
.headers on
#+end_src

*** Show tables
~.tables~

*** Show schema
~.schema <table name>~

*** Show current settings
~.show~

** Alter Table
Sqlite does not have all the capabilities of other databases. For Altering tables, there are a number of reasons why you cannot drop a column ([[https://sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html][docs]]). More or less, I cannot drop columns if they have a foreign key reference.
